# IS3107_SpotifyPlus

## Motivation
As a popular digital music streaming platform, Spotify allows artists from different nations to release elaborate albums, attract followers and gain popularity from audience all across the world. In 2022, there are approximate 800 million artists on Spotify, with 165000 of them having more than 10000 listeners monthly. As many other streaming platforms do, Spotify offers a service ‘Spotify for Artists’, which give artists tips on creating and promoting music, connecting with fans, studying the fanbase, managing artist profile, and commercializing their popularity. Despite its complete analysis on fanbase and artist-fan relationship, Spotify does not provide quantifiable and concrete suggestions about music production, while the only thing it offers are articles about past stories of various scenarios. This introduces obstacles for artists to understand the whole picture of the current music market on Spotify and thus makes it difficult to quantify the future popularity of their new songs. 
Furthermore, for artists to compare their songs horizontally, Spotify should have tagged each track with genre labels. However, Spotify only attaches genre labels for artists and albums, while a genre field is not required for artists or music companies to input new tracks into the Spotify song library. This inexplicit genre labelling system is inaccurate. For instance, an album labelled by ‘K-Pop’ may contains b-side songs that are not typically K-Pop but likely to be in the ‘R&B’ genre. Also, an artist mainly composing ‘Pop’ (referring to Western Pop in the Spotify categorization system) songs may produce ‘Indie’ music from time to time to show special emotions. Therefore, Spotify will need a classification system enabling artists to identify what kind of songs others are producing in a certain genre.
